## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

dev: `npm run dev`

build: `npm run build`, this will create a folder `out` with everything you need to deploy.



More info about the framework: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) 



## Branches

- `develop` for development purpose
- `main` for official staging link



## Info

- **Content:** Most of the content is in the `data` folder, splitted based on sections. Some basic content, like footer / heaader and small words are hard-coded directly in the components.
- **Internal links:** I'm using the plain `<a>` tag instead because the pages are only secondary (terms/privacy) so I'm not handling using the `next-router`
