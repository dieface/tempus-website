## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

dev: `npm run dev`

build: `npm run build`



More info: [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) 



## INFO

- **Content:** Most of the content is in the `data` folder, splitted based on sections
- **Internal links:** I'm using the plain `<a>` tag instead because the pages are only secondary (terms/privacy) so I'm not handling using the `next-router`
