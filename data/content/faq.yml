      - title: What is Tempus?
        description: Tempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed rate protocol built on the Ethereum network. Tempus also functions as a yield aggregation tool that aims to deliver additional returns on yield bearing tokens.
      - title: How does Tempus work?
        description: |
          Tempus allows users to deposit various yield bearing tokens (YBT) such as stETH (Lido Staked ETH) or aDAI (Aave Interest Bearing Dai) into contracts with select maturities. For ease, users will also be allowed to deposit the Backing Token (BT) such as ETH for direct deposit onto another platform through Tempus.<br /> Tempus then separates the YBT into a Principals and Yields and allows users to:
            <ol>
              <li>Buy and sell interest rate protection using any supported Yield Bearing Token (such as stETH, cDai).</li>
              <li>Earn swap fees as a liquidity provider by depositing any supported Yield Bearing Token (on top of yield earned through yield farming protocols).</li>
            </ol>

      - title: What are yield bearing tokens (YBT)?
        description: Yield bearing tokens (YBT) are derivatives that appreciate in value as a result of their participation in some form of yield farming. Some examples of YBT are aDai (Aave Interest Bearing Dai), XSushi (staked Sushi) or stETH (Lido staked ETH).
      - title: What are Principals?
        description: Principals are split out of YBT together with the Yields. The Principal is a zero-coupon bond that is redeemable for face value on maturity.
      - title: What are Yields?
        description: Yields are split out of YBT together with the Principals. The Yield is a zero-coupon bond that is redeemable for the amount of yield that accrues on each unit of Principals on maturity.

      - title: How are rates on Tempus determined?
        description: The exchange rate (ratio of reserves on both sides) between the Principals and the Yields in each TempusAMM determines the market implied APY for each pool.
      - title: What are the fees for using Tempus?
        description: Tempus does not charge any protocol fees. However, there are two kinds of fees that users pay. The first one is swap fees, all of which go to liquidity providers (LPs) who provide liquidity to each TempusAMM. The second one is gas fees you generally pay for using the Ethereum network.

      - title: Is Tempus audited?
        description: Tempus has been audited by Coinspect, and will be audited by Code4rena in October 2021. The audit reports will be published on this website.
      - title: How can Tempus provide minimal counterparty risk?
        description: Tempus does not use leverage in the traditional sense and doesnâ€™t require the use of collateral - what happens is that users redistribute risk among each other by trading two derivatives (the Principals and the Yields) of the yield bearing token (YBT) against each other.
      - title: What are the risks associated with using Tempus?
        description: Tempus is an early-stage, experimental protocol. There is no equivalent product in traditional financial markets - DYOR!
